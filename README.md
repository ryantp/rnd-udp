# rnd-udp

rnd-udp (Random User Defined Processes) -- a collection of simple scripts that enhance system commands (mostly going to be Win32 based).

=================================================
Repo Notes:

In my day job, I get to do a certain process
which puts me in the position to have access to
a computer and use (most) all the tools to do
said process.

Since I moonlight as a programmer, I tend to
take some inspiration from those tools (
including all their faults (good stuff to learn
from :P)), and implement my own (although
_my_ scripts are more along the lines of sys-
administation).

================================================

LIST:
- better_win_taskkill.py -- interactive taskkill program (still being polished); call without params for interactive session, with params for single-call cli use
                              (NOTE: gets called from batch file called `tkill.bat` (on local machine).)
- fibn.py -- simple fibonocci program, because why not?
