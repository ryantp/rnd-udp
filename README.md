# rnd-udp

rnd-udp (Random User Defined Processes) -- a collection of simple scripts that enhance system commands (mostly going to be Win32 based).

LIST:
- better_win_taskkill.py -- interactive taskkill program (still being polished); call without params for interactive session, with params for single-call cli use
                              (NOTE: gets called from batch file called tkill.bat (on local machine) which handles args vs. no args)
